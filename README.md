### Future Development

    1. Households
       A. Some users may have multiple homes they need to budget for, and we plan to implement functionality to create, edit, and delete households that contain their own budgets, expenses, and income. There would be a 'default' view, which would show all households, budget amounts, total amount of expenses, and total amount of income, and the user could switch between the macro 'default' view and each individual household for a more in depth look.
    2. Sorting
        A. We plan to allow users to sort their budgets, expenses, and income by amounts, name, type, and date in the View All page.
        We would also like to allow users to re-assign the different expenses they have entered.
    3. Month to Month
        A. We plan to implement a month to month budgeting functionality that users can use to see their monthly budgets, expenses, and incomes with statistics. Budget categories would be carried over each month with expenses and income being reset. Statistics would show the net income minus expenses, budgets that the user went over or under with a percentage amount and dollar amount, and an overall user net savings that sums all income and all expenses on the account.
    4. Excel Exporting
        A. We plan to allow the user to export their budget, expenses, and income to an excel spreadsheet.
